			<h5 class="col-title" style="text-align:center;line-height: 24px">Modernization of Driving Licensing and Education</h5>
				<div class="conc-strong">
					The NHTSA states that, distracted driving is the number one cause of accidents and a, "deadly epidemic."
					<br>Over a million people died in auto accidents last year and another two million were seriously injured!
				</div>
				<br>
				<div class="conc-normal">
					There are six billion mobile phone users and a billion vehicles interacting on the roads daily.
					<br>Modern vehicles are loaded with new technical devices and carry-ons that present driver distraction. <br><br>Varying type and degree of intoxicated driving is widespread.
					<br>The many new driving concentration challenges dictate the need to update twentieth century driver licensing, education, and training. Valuable new safety ideas can help reduce accidents, while at the same time offer additional licensing revenues. DMV, educators, and those with consumer protection concerns, are now presented with an opportunity to modernize driving licensing and education, standards and practices.<br><br>The Automobile Safety Foundation, a non profit organization (founded 1988) is introducing novel	safety ideas and programs based on the science of road concentration; the required cognitive discipline to sustain road concentration while remaining undistracted. ASF believes the current driving mentality requires a reprogramming from old school driving practices (including the influence of media and Hollywood movies depicting cars that drive themselves, and frivolous driving behaviors) and be introduced to <span style="color:rgb(191,144,0);">intelligent driving</span>, a new driving psychology, that is interesting, easy to learn, and not at all unpleasant. <br><br><span style="color:rgb(191,144,0);">Intelligent driving</span> trains with the simple tools, Eyes on the Road/Hands on the Wheel, Practice Road Concentration, Avoid Driver Distraction, and the ASF <span style="color:rgb(191,144,0);">Copilot License</span> (CL) with safe driving technique for both driver and passengers. ASF submits CL training as a new international industry standard, that should be part of the required protocol necessary to obtain a driving license. The new program could include initiating Copilot License education and training prior to obtaining a driver permit, while also apprising passengers how to copilot to help drive safely.  DMV issuing mobile phone licenses could also multitask the CL for an official ID card or offer it for a small charge to the safety-minded that want to make a DMV road concentration safe driver pledge. Obtaining a CL should be a requirement for a moving violation ticket, that would include purchasing of the CL for a additional ticket charge (prioritized over other non-safety tariffs etc.) as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5FwyYvBMrM" target="_blank">going to CL school online</a> to learn about road concentration, and the lesson of being socially responsible, as on the road we all copilot and unsafe driving endangers others.<br><br> ASF believes that all international licensing agencies, U.S. state DMV, Ministries of Transportation, and licensing bureaus in worldwide, offer new <span style="color:rgb(191,144,0);">intelligent driving</span> education that includes the science of road concentration, <span style="color:rgb(191,144,0);">Eyes on the Road/Hands on the Wheel</span>, that increases road concentration while decreasing distracted driving.
					<br><br>
					Mobile driving licenses, mDL, can offer a user friendly platform for the purchase of the Copilot License.
