        <div align="left">"For we strive not against flesh and blood, but 
          against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of darkness 
          of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places" (Eph 
          vi:12)<br>
          <br>
          The automobile is the number one cause of harm and death to our people 
          1-40.<br>
          <br>
          For over thirty years, government and the automobile companies have 
          equipped vehicles with a lethal spring-loaded steering lock theft device, 
          that makes auto theft easy (auto theft has tripled since the inception 
          of this lock 1969) while causing harm and death by steering lockup on 
          moving vehicles. Steering locks have no merit whatsoever, and since 
          they increase auto theft, and harm and kill, they constitute a machination, 
          and crime against humanity.<br>
          <br>
          It is <b>DOWNRIGHT PLAIN TRUTH </b><font color="#000000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">that 
          the steering lock, is the world yoke of oppression and tyranny, and 
          along with auto pollution, threaten the well being and safety of all 
          of mankind. The Automobile Safety Foundation (501(c)(3) organization) 
          <b>LA CA MUSIC</b> (ASCAP) and POETRY BAND ("Viva Jesus!") 
          declare that people must band together for freedom, and take remedial 
          actions to address this international crisis, and also to address other 
          urgent international human rights issues, such as alternative fuels, 
          promoting peace, feeding the hungry and unveiling real medicines, like 
          Bloodroot (sanguinaria condensis, a cure for cancer ref. Dr. Andrew 
          Weil).</font></div>

          Let's work together, for an international human rights concert, and 
          fund raising events. Steering lock warning and education and remedial 
          actions save lives. General Motors and Ford have begun replacing steering 
          locks with safe and modern auto theft prevention technology. Both GM 
          and Ford also have alternative fuel vehicles now on the road. A new 
          industry standard has been set. Now we call upon bands, artists, human 
          rights organizations, investors, producers, sponsors, promoters, and 
          all concerned parties, to network to produce this human rights event, 
          and strive in all other ways, for the progress and safety of mankind. 
          Give us liberty! Let the People Go!</font></p>
